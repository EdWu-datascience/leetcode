
#question:
#a robat located at a m√ón grid, and the robat can only move the right or down for one step each time
#calculate how many paths do we have to get to the point (m-1,n-1)


#f(i,j)represent the number of paths to point(i,j),and we can have this equation: f(i,j)=f(i-1,j)+f(i,j-1)
#boundary condition:
#i-1 <0 when i == 0 and j-1 < 0 when j == 0
#so we need to put these point out of for loop. We also need to consider the value of m and n in case one of them == 1 
#so there will no (0,1) or (1,0)
